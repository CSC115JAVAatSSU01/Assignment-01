8.15 (Rational Numbers) Create a class called Rational for performing arithmetic with fractions. Write a program to test your class. Use integer variables to represent the private instance variables of the class—the numerator and the denominator. Provide a constructor that enables an object of this class to be initialized when it’s declared. The constructor should store the fraction in reduced form. The fraction 2/4 is equivalent to 1/2 and would be stored in the object as 1 in the numerator and 2 in the denominator. Provide a no-argument constructor with default values in case no initializers are provided. Provide public methods that perform each of the following operations:
a) Add two Rational numbers: The result of the addition should be stored in reduced form. Implement this as a static method.
b) Subtract two Rational numbers: The result of the subtraction should be stored in reduced form. Implement this as a static method.
c) Multiply two Rational numbers: The result of the multiplication should be stored in reduced form. Implement this as a static method.
d) Divide two Rational numbers: The result of the division should be stored in reduced form. Implement this as a static method.
e) Return a String representation of a Rational number in the form a/b, where a is the numerator and b is the denominator.
f) Return a String representation of a Rational number in floating-point format. (Consider providing formatting capabilities that enable the user of the class to specify the number of digits of precision to the right of the decimal point.)
8.16 (Huge Integer Class) Create a class HugeInteger which uses a 40-element array of digits to store integers as large as 40 digits each. Provide methods parse, toString, add and subtract. Method parse should receive a String, extract each digit using method charAt and place the integer equivalent of each digit into the integer array. For comparing HugeInteger objects, provide the following methods: isEqualTo, isNotEqualTo, isGreaterThan, isLessThan, isGreaterThanOrEqualTo and isLessThanOrEqualTo. Each of these is a predicate method that returns true if the relationship holds between the two HugeInteger objects and returns false if the relationship does not hold. Provide a predicate method isZero. If you feel ambitious, also provide methods multiply, divide and remainder. [Note: Primitive boolean values can be output as the word “true” or the word “false” with format specifier %b.]
